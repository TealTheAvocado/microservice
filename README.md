## How to request data

In order to request data, the Flask API must be running. To do this, run `python app.py` in the terminal in the folder containing `app.py`. For best results, run `source venv/bin/activate` first, although not required.

The Flask API will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:5002 but can be changed to a different port as needed by changing this line of code `if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5002) `

Within the application to make the request, a function can be written similar to this `requests.get(http://127.0.0.1:5002/get_data)`. 

## How to receive data

The received data from running `requests.get(http://127.0.0.1:5002/get_data)` is a JSON that the program receiving must parse through. This command can be saved to a variable to more easily work with the resultant data `data = requests.get(http://127.0.0.1:5002/get_data)`.
